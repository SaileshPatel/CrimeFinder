CrimeFinder
===========

CrimeFinder was the Team Marauder project for #YRS2013, which Edward, Liza, IJ, Max and Mathew were a part of. I'm not entirely sure how the back-end stuff works, so bits and pieces may be missing, however I've made sure that all our front-end stuff is here and works. 
Unfortunately due to my lack of back-end knowledge, I can't answer any questions on this, however I do know that it came from 'data.gov.uk' and that it is in a JSON format.
Have fun kids!!!
